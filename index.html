            <p>




<p>For the listener, who listens in the snow, <br>And, nothing himself, beholds <br>Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. <br>&mdash; Wallace Stevens</p>
<br><br>
<p>What does solitude in digital environments feel like? In a world of fast, efficient, and goal-oriented media, John Vanderhoef and Matthew Thomas Payne introduce the notion of “slow game time” to describe subversive temporalities in game design. In Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar Studios’ 2018 blockbuster western saga), players are encouraged to linger—doing nothing in particular but simply wandering the expansive wilderness or gazing at its vast horizon. These moments of pause become a kind of stillness that resists productivity.</p>
<br>
<p>This stillness—this idle, marginal space of non-doing—also finds resonance in the poetics of Wallace Stevens. In Stevens’ philosophy, nothingness is not merely an absence but a generative field “against which the idea of existence needs to be understood and defined.” Rather than destruction, it becomes “the dialectical antithesis of creation”—the womb of possibility, a space from which meaning can emerge (Pack, 2003). 

<br><br>
Wastelands was conceived as a project that rejects the logic of efficiency, friendliness, and purposefulness embedded in many capitalist digital interfaces. Like a first visit to an unfamiliar city—cold, slow, incomprehensible—this digital landscape delays interpretation, resists clarity, and invites quiet contemplation. Its low-resolution context does not offer immediate meaning; instead, the very ambiguity opens room for personal myth-making. The strangeness of an unexplained space becomes a canvas for reflection. As Stevens writes, imagination “searches a possible for its possibleness” (CP 481).</p>
<br>
<p>The installation consists of two main elements:<br>
  – A tactile interface composed of a 6×6 grid, forming 36 small circular openings<br>
  – An LED matrix screen that displays generative text output from a fine-tuned language model</p>
<br>
      <h3>
            <img src="images/proj1-2.gif" alt="2022" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"></h3>
      <br>
<p>The interface functions as a space for accidental encounters. As participants place their hands over the openings, some of them trigger AI-generated text based on hidden prompts. The resulting phrases are often fragmentary—poetic, cryptic, or obliquely suggestive. Other holes yield nothing at all. </p>
<br>
<p>This rough, unhelpful, and even contradictory interface is crucial to the experience. The goal is not to inform or entertain but to create a liminal space of indirect engagement&mdash;where the user is neither fully in control nor completely lost. The machine was developed using Raspberry Pi and Python, with a custom-trained language model.</p>
<br>
<p>By transforming digital interactivity into something slow, imprecise, and contemplative, Wastelands attempts to subvert dominant narratives of technological immediacy. It opens a space in which digital solitude can be experienced not as an absence, but as a presence of hesitation&mdash;an invitation to behold &ldquo;the nothing that is.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Flashlight: On the Blurring Boundaries Between Observer and Observed in Korean Horror Entertainment </h2>

    <p>




      This project began as a collaborative inquiry into how horror media constructs—and destabilizes—the boundary between normality and abnormality. Early on, we were interested not only in the conventions of horror itself, but also in how audiences consume and participate in it. Depending on the media format, the audience may engage as semi-viewers: writing comments, liking or recommending content, or even acting as partial co-creators within participatory formats like escape-room games. In doing so, they become not only co-authors of the narrative in a broad sense, but also subjects who perform the gaze of othering—a core mechanism of horror.
<br><br>
We chose to focus on the popular South Korean escape-room variety show The Great Escape(대탈출), specifically a two-part episode set in a fictional psychiatric hospital. The episode deploys typical horror conventions: a surveillance-heavy institution, eerie figures, and narrative frameworks of confinement and paranoia. Yet it also functions as light entertainment, driven by a cast of well-known comedians navigating the horror setting with comedic undertones.
<br><br>
What fascinated us most was that these protagonists were both characters and genre-aware viewers. The scenario begins with the celebrities waking up in a psychiatric facility—confined not for any plausible diagnosis, but for fictional or exaggerated ailments that do not exist in real life. Aware of the horror tropes at play, the participants constantly shift registers: they engage seriously with the escape mechanics while deliberately resisting the mood from becoming too terrifying—both for themselves and the audience.<br><br>

        </p>

       
      <p>
        <img src="images/proj2-2.png" alt="2022" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<br>
This form of genre subversion often hinges on spatial dynamics. For instance, one early moment reverses the usual surveillance trope: after realizing they’re being watched, the protagonists step out into the lobby and begin to observe the observers. It is no coincidence that much of horror depends on spatial estrangement. Sometimes this means defamiliarizing the domestic (as in many haunted-house films), and other times it means placing viewers in liminal spaces—abandoned malls, empty stairwells, or deserted schoolyards. The liminal space aesthetic, which gained popularity online after 2020, evokes uncanny discomfort through settings that should be populated but are eerily vacant.
<br><br>
Still, The Great Escape remains a game show. While the characters perform fear and confusion within an unfamiliar space, they are also puzzle-solvers who know they must escape. This double stance—half immersed, half strategic—extends not only to the space, but also to the secondary characters within it. These NPC-like figures, portrayed as hospital staff or patients, are appropriated as narrative devices for horror, only to be re-absorbed into a comic rhythm to maintain the balance of the show. The player-viewers themselves other these figures in two conflicting directions: first, to render them sufficiently "creepy" for horror, and second, to neutralize that horror into something safely comedic.
<img src="images/proj2-4.png" alt="2022" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<br><br>
     
Within The Great Escape, the psychiatric hospital setting functions both as a recognizable horror space and a playground for subversion. The participants, while trapped within an environment saturated with horror conventions, routinely destabilize those conventions through humor, self-parody, and selective distancing. This half-performer, half-spectator stance reveals the complex layering of gaze, power, and identity in contemporary media.
<br><br>
The project culminated in a 140-page collaborative research volume. One metaphor that emerged as central during our investigation into othering was the “flashlight.” In Korean author Lee Cheongjun’s short story The Wall of Rumor, a powerful motif is the blinding beam of a flashlight, which hides the identity of the observer while exposing the observed. The imbalance of visibility becomes a symbol for the asymmetry of knowledge, surveillance, and power—key themes not only in literature but also in how horror media operates at the boundary of spectatorship and participation.
<img src="images/proj2-1.png" alt="2022" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<br>
In critically engaging with The Great Escape, we also acknowledged its problematic aspects. Although framed as comedy, the show inevitably commodifies real-world stigmas associated with mental illness. Yet, precisely because of its hybrid genre—neither pure horror nor pure comedy—the show inadvertently exposes the fragility of normative categories. Characters oscillate between victim, perpetrator, and fool; spaces oscillate between safe and uncanny. Through this project, we examined how horror entertainment not only reflects but actively performs the instability of social classifications.

    <h2>Concreteglyph: A Narrative Archaeology in Ruin</h2>

<h3> <img src="images/proj3.png" alt="2023" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;"></h3>
    <p>

Concreteglyph is a personal Unity-based project that invites the player to wander through a desolate 3D environment rendered in a pencil-sketched aesthetic. The space resembles a ruin—abstracted, uninhabited, and uncontextualized. No humans appear. No goal is defined. The only available actions are 1) to roam, and 2) to project hand-drawn images onto the walls of the ruin. These projected images are not of this world: they depict moments of suspended action—figures in airports, malls, urban corridors—waiting, staring, going somewhere or nowhere.
<br><br>
Inspired by Marc Augé’s notion of non-places, the images evoke the affect of transit zones that feel simultaneously familiar and unreal. And yet, the ruin in which they are projected is not a non-place in Augé’s original sense: it lacks the systems of flow and anonymity that define such spaces. Instead, the ruin serves as a substrate—a posthuman landscape where residuals of past life are ambiguously reanimated. Projection, in this context, becomes a performative archaeology. As McAulay (2008) notes of J.G. Ballard, “the posthuman is also the prehuman,” a condition in which human absence recycles into speculative futures and pasts (p. 31).
<br><br>
Images are projected onto uneven, cracked surfaces—not onto clean screens—so that the viewer always perceives both the image and the wall beneath it. This layering builds a temporal dissonance. The projections, along with the user’s movement, evoke a Platonian cave dynamic: the player glimpses flickering shadows of a past they cannot fully reconstruct. Texts occasionally appear alongside the images—fragmentary captions such as:
<br><br>
</p>
<div class="leftborder">
“In this place, every direction felt like a return.”<br>
“You could leave, but you’d arrive exactly where you began.”<br>
“They called it circulation, but it was more like forgetting in motion.”<br>
    
</div> 
      <p>  
        <img src="images/proj3-2.gif" alt="2023" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<br><br>
These ephemeral phrases provide no guidance, only affect. They reinforce what Etkind describes as the paradox of memory systems: “Monuments without texts are mute, while texts without monuments are ephemeral” (Warped Mourning, p. 177). In Concreteglyph, this paradox is enacted directly—the monument (ruin) and text (projection) are bound only briefly, before dissolving into ambiguity.
<br><br>
The work draws from Mark Fisher’s reading of hauntology as a mode of aesthetic time: “landscapes stained by time,” where “time is out of joint” (What Is Hauntology?, p. 21). The player is neither a ghost nor a survivor, but something closer to a speculative archaeologist—one who cannot extract truth, only hints. There is no end, no escape. The player does not depart the ruin; they were always already living inside it.
<br><br>
Rather than deliver a conventional narrative, Concreteglyph assembles a narrative affect. It asks what it means to construct history not through revelation or memory, but through the act of projection—a gesture that is uncertain, momentary, and possibly misdirected.

    <p>
      Cellophane is a VR-based interactive work that explores how we remember spaces—especially those we only briefly saw, or which no longer exist. The project investigates the ephemerality of spatial memory and how visual fragments can be reactivated and re-related as narrative traces. Inspired by the transformation of Korean cities—particularly the rise of standardized apartment complexes and the simultaneous disappearance of urban parks and open greens—this work considers how memory operates equally in rigid architectures and organic landscapes: through the gaze, through framing, and through loss.
      <br><br>
      The player inhabits a three-dimensional virtual environment structured by a massive glass wall composed of grid-like transparent panels. Each panel functions as a window, revealing a shifting scene beyond: some show blurry human figures drifting through open spaces, while others display dense fields of buildings. The world beyond the grid is non-Euclidean—each panel may contain a different spatial logic, evoking the layered and disjointed nature of memory.
      <img src="images/proj4-2.png" alt="2025" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
      <br>
      Using their right hand, players can draw freely on the glass. Most lines leave no trace—until the player draws a closed geometric shape, such as a circle or square. The space visible through that frame is then named by the system using a AI language model, generating poetic or uncanny descriptions such as:<br><br>
  
 
    <div class="leftborder">
      "A person wearing earphones, but hearing nothing."<br>
      "An empty bench once occupied by someone."
        
    </div> 
         

<br><p>
These descriptions are constantly shifting, as both the environment and the player’s gaze change over time. If nothing visible appears through the frame, the system instead renders:</p>

<br>
<div class="leftborder">
  "Nothing yet."<br>
  "A space where something used to be."
    
</div> <br>
<p>
  <img src="images/proj4-gif1.gif" alt="2025" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
 <div class="description">Blurry human figures pass behind the glass panels. As the player completes a geometric frame with their index finger, the name of what they see through the frame briefly appears—only to change moments later to “A space where something used to be.”</div>
<br><br><p>
The player can also clench and unclench their right hand to switch to a dashed line mode, which enables them to connect multiple frames. When two or more memory-frames are linked, a new sentence appears—forming speculative associations between the initial observations. Over time, this process creates a map of procedural texts: an emergent narrative of remembered fragments and their imagined relations.<br><br>
<img src="images/proj4-gif2.gif" alt="2025" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<div class="description">The player connects two frames in dotted-line mode. The lower frame has been labeled “Someone who asks meaningless questions.” Once the connection is complete, a new sentence emerges: “Someone who asks meaningless questions stands in front of an automatic door that froze at dawn.”</div><br><br>
<p>Even imprecise gestures—shaky or incomplete shapes—are part of the memory system. The software detects closed shapes on a planar layer and registers their position relative to the player’s gaze, recognizing the act of looking itself as a method of inscription. In this way, Cellophane becomes a poetic and procedural archive of ephemeral moments: a place to witness memory’s cycle of formation, retention, loss, and re-narration.
